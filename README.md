#About Me
Hello! My name is Kevin Salina. I have been self-learning web development for 6 months, and excited to hone in my skills with the help of this bootcamp. I love golf, snowboarding, 90s alternative rock, and computers! My favorite sports team is the Dallas Cowboys (much to my chagrin), and favorite pro golfer is Viktor Hovland. 

As a side project - I developed an interactive map for Golfing Magazine, which allows users to browse through golf courses on their annual golf certificate. You can view a demo of the map [here](https://golfingmag-map-2021.herokuapp.com/). (Be patient, it may take 30 seconds to load).
